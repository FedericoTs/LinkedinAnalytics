## Step-by-Step Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Core Text Creation Functionality
1. **Project Setup**
   - [ ] Initialize the React + TypeScript project (if not already done).
   - [ ] Set up Supabase authentication (already in use per project memory).
   - [ ] Establish folder structure for components, contexts, and utilities.

2. **User Account Management**
   - [ ] Ensure user login/logout flows are functional.
   - [ ] Implement user context for session management.

3. **Text Editor**
   - [ ] Integrate a rich text editor (e.g., Slate, Draft.js, or Quill).
   - [ ] Add LinkedIn-specific character/word count limits.
   - [ ] Implement draft saving (local storage or Supabase).

4. **Content Type Selection**
   - [ ] Create UI for selecting between post/article, manual/AI writing, and content purpose.

---

### Phase 2: Basic AI Assistance for Content Generation
